After the New York state repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret, records that investigates complaints by the public about New York City police officers were released. The data provides the closed cases of every active-duty police officer who had at least one substantiated allegation against them. The records span decades, from September 1985 to January 2020. This project serves as a deep look into this data set to investigate different aspects of the complaints.
